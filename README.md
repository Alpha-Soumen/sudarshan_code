# 🎓 EduEvent Hub – Event Management System for Institutes

**EduEvent** is a real-time event management system built for educational institutes, developed in a 7-hour hackathon with a 5-hour MVP focus. Designed as a modern web application, it supports two primary user types—**Students/Participants** and **College Authorities/Event Managers**—and streamlines core activities like event creation, participant registration, seat tracking, and minimal canteen display. The system leverages **Next.js**, **Supabase**, and **Tailwind CSS** for rapid development, real-time updates, and clean design.
